# üöÄ Rails 8 Demo App ‚Äì GitHub Codespaces Ready

This repository demonstrates how to generate high‚Äëfidelity PDFs from Rails views using  
**[`bidi2pdf-rails`](https://rubygems.org/gems/bidi2pdf-rails)** ‚Äî a modern, native alternative to Grover or WickedPDF.

---

## üîß Key Technologies

- **Rails 8** ‚Äì The latest version of the Ruby on Rails framework
- **bidi2pdf-rails** ‚Äì PDF generation via ChromeDriver‚Äôs **BiDi (Bidirectional) protocol**
- **Propshaft** ‚Äì A lightweight, modern asset pipeline
- **Importmaps** ‚Äì JavaScript without bundlers or Node
- **Stimulus** ‚Äì A minimal JavaScript framework for progressive enhancements
- **Page.js** ‚Äì Fast, client‚Äëside navigation with zero SPA overhead

> **Goal:** Showcase how to leverage `bidi2pdf-rails` for clean, browser‚Äëaccurate PDF rendering inside Rails, using
> Chrome‚Äôs native BiDi protocol‚Äîno Puppeteer, no wkhtmltopdf, no hassle.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Instant Setup with GitHub Codespaces

This app is **fully pre‚Äëconfigured for GitHub Codespaces**, making onboarding as smooth as possible.

### üèÅ Getting Started:

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Open** it in a GitHub Codespace
3. **Wait** for the container to build and run `bin/setup` (takes a few minutes)
4. **Start the Rails server**:

```bash
./bin/rails s -b 0.0.0.0
```

> Access the app via the forwarded port shown in the Codespace interface.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Bundler Caveat: Accessibility Dependencies

Running `bundle install` will attempt to compile two optional gems:

- **`xmp_toolkit_ruby`**
- **`qpdf_ruby`**

Both gems contain native C extensions that depend on the system libraries **`xmp‚Äëtoolkit`** and **`qpdf`**. If those
libraries are not available for your operating system (or you do not have the required build tools installed), the
compilation step will fail.

**You have two options:**

1. **Install the libraries manually** and re‚Äërun `bundle install`.

- macOS: `brew install qpdf`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt‚Äëget install libqpdf‚Äëdev` (or the equivalent packages for your distro)

‚ö†Ô∏èFor XMP Toolkit, see   <https://github.com/dieter-medium/xmp_toolkit_ruby>
or <https://github.com/adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK>

2. **Skip the accessibility post‚Äëprocessing** by disabling it:

   ```bash
   # Skip native extensions for accessibility
   DISABLE_ACCESSIBILITY=1 bundle install

   # Start Rails with accessibility features disabled
   DISABLE_ACCESSIBILITY=1 bin/rails s
   ```

When `DISABLE_ACCESSIBILITY=1` is set, the app works fine, **but the accessibility examples (tagged PDFs, embedded XMP
metadata, etc.) are omitted**, because they rely on the native post‚Äëprocessing performed by the two gems above.

## Decvontainers with rubymine

RubyMine now installs mise at launch. So you need to run the following command to install mise:

```bash
mise settings add idiomatic_version_file_enable_tools ruby
mise use -g ruby@3.4.3
```

## üñ®Ô∏è PDF Generation with `bidi2pdf-rails`

The gem uses **ChromeDriver's BiDi protocol** to:

- Launch and control a Chromium browser
- Render full browser output to PDF
- Avoid fragile, legacy PDF tools like wkhtmltopdf
- Keep everything inside your Rails stack ‚Äî no Node, no extra services

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Optional: Visual Browser Rendering via VNC

You can observe exactly what Chromium renders by connecting to the live browser instance through VNC.

### üîß VNC Setup Instructions:

```bash
# In your GitHub Codespace:
# Open the "Ports" tab and forward port 5900

# On your local machine:
gh auth status
# If not authenticated:
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | gh auth login --with-token

gh codespace list
gh codespace ports forward 5900:6000
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Connect with VNC Viewer:

- Open `vnc://localhost:6000` in your VNC viewer  
  (macOS shortcut: Finder ‚Üí ‚åò + K ‚Üí enter the URL)

- Password: Defined in `.devcontainer/compose.yml` under `VNC_PASS`, or check the container logs if undefined.

## üöÄ Deployment with Kamal

This app is ready for **simple, single‚Äëmachine deployment with [Kamal](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal)**.

You'll need [`sops`](https://github.com/getsops/sops) to manage encrypted secrets.

### üîê Add production secrets:

```bash
sops edit .kamal/production.secrets.yml
```

Example content:

```yaml
mysql_root_password: ...
mysql_password: ...
registry_password: ...
minio_root_password: ...
master_key: ...
```

### üåç Configure your environment:

Set the following variables in your environment or `.env` file:

```bash
SERVER_IP=<your-server-ip>
USER_ID=<kamal-uid>
GROUP_ID=<kamal-gid>
```

### üö¢ Deploy:

```bash
kamal server bootstrap -v \
  && kamal accessory boot all \
  && kamal deploy -v
```
